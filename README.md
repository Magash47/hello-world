# hello-world
My very first reposiroty

Hello there, Thabang Elias here. About myself? Well, I'm just a simple guy, what you see is what you get.
I love writing code and more than that, I love learning new things everyday, mostly because I get bored if I keep doing the same thing for extended periods of time.
I play guitar, or at least try to. I definetely can't sing, so there's that.
I love food, I'll eat anything in sight. I also love mountain biking, but love video games even more, who doesn't?
If there's one thing I can't live without, it's internet. I always have to be connected, I'd rather starve than not have internet.
